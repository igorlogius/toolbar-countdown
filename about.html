Shows a custom countdown in the toolbar. Well technically it only shows the most significant part. (days) at least until none are left then it gradually drops (goes to hours, then minutes and finally seconds) 

<b>Usage:</b>
<ol>
	<li>install the add-on </li>
	<li>click the toolbar button</li>
	<li>enter a countdown end date</li>
	<li>close popup</li>
</ol>
